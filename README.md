Photoshop Actions
=======================

The files in this repository contains several Photoshop Actions i created over time to help cropping, image manipulation, and so on.

These are *.atn files, which means you have to import them on your photoshop to work.

I created those actions using Photoshop CS6, so im not sure if its going to work in future versions. Its up to you to test and use.

## How to install? (CS6 based instructions)

1. Open your photoshop
2. Click into Window->Action menu.
3. Once its opened, click on the little down arrow located at top-right of the window.
4. You will see a menu with several options, select "Load Actions"
5. A File window will open, select the ATN file in this repository and its done!
